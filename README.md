# Adapter Pattern Example using C#


Definition:
Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. 
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.


The Adapter pattern allows a system to use classes of another system that is 
incompatible with it. It is especially used for toolkits and libraries.
